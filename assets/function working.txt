1.uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a file to send", type=None):
st.file_uploader() creates a file upload button in your Streamlit app.
The label "Choose a file to send" is the text shown next to the button.
When a user uploads a file, that file is stored in the variable uploaded_file.

2️.temp_path = os.path.join(".", uploaded_file.name)
os.path.join(".", uploaded_file.name) combines two parts into a full file path.
"." means the current folder.
uploaded_file.name is the name of the uploaded file (like photo.jpg or data.csv)
look like this (./photo.jpg)

3️⃣ with open(temp_path, "wb") as f:
This opens a new empty file with that name (temp_path)
so we can save the uploaded data into it.
"wb" means write in binary mode, which is needed for all types of files (images, PDFs, etc.).
The with keyword automatically closes the file after writing.

4️⃣ f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())
uploaded_file.getbuffer() gives the raw bytes of the uploaded file.
f.write(...) writes those bytes into the new file we just opened.

5️⃣ with st.spinner(f"Sending '{uploaded_file.name}' to {dest_ip}:{port}..."):
st.spinner() shows a temporary loading spinner in the Streamlit app while the code inside it runs.
The text inside f"..." is shown to the user (like a “please wait” message).
Example:Sending 'photo.jpg' to 192.168.0.10:8080...

6.port = st.number_input("Enter Port Number", value=9999, step=1, format="%d")
value=9999
This sets the default value that appears in the box when the app first loads.
So by default, it shows 9999, but the user can change it.
step=1
This defines how much the number changes when you click the little up/down arrows next to the box.
So with step=1, each click increases or decreases the number by 1.
format="%d"
This tells Streamlit how to display the number.
"%d" means show it as an integer (whole number) — no decimals.

7.(max_retries)This retry continues until:
You finally get the ack, or
You hit the max retry limit (max_retries, default 5).

If retries exceed the limit, it raises a TimeoutError and stops sending.
